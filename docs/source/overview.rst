Overview

Federated Learning is a machine learning technique for training models on distributed 
data without sharing it. In traditional machine learning, large datasets must first be collected 
and then sent to one location where they can be combined before the model is trained on them. 
However, this process can cause privacy concerns as sensitive personal data may become publicly available. 
Federated learning attempts to address these concerns by keeping individual user's data local while still allowing 
for powerful powerful statistical analysis that can be used to create accurate models at scale.
